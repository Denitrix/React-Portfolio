          Hello, I'm a 24-year-old from Minnesota with a penchant for tabletop
          role-playing games (TTRPGs), reading, and video games. Currently, I'm
          immersing myself in the world of web development as a student. When
          I'm not coding, you can often find me engrossed in a good book,
          strategizing with friends in TTRPG campaigns, or exploring virtual
          landscapes. I value the balance between creativity and technical
          skill, and I'm dedicated to mastering both. Let's connect and share
          our experiences, whether it's about code, stories, or adventures in
          gaming.
